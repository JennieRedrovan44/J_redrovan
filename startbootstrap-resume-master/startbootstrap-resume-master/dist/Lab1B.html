                            For the Prelab for 1B, I had to install both Python 3 and pip. I had to make sure that I had the latest releases of both Python and pip afterwords (just to be sure!).
                            I then had to create the A virtual environment and installed Python Packages. I proceeded to download and unzip the codebase into my project directory.
                            Finally, I started the Jupyter server and read through processing commands on the Artemis board.

                            Configuration:
                            By following the configuration instructions, I was able to update the  Artemis MAC Address on my Computer. As shown below:

                        <p>
                        I also was able to generate a new UUID and then replaced BLEService UUID with the generated UUID. As shown below:

                            In task 1, I had to program the Artemis to echo back the data that was sent to it. 
                            The a Artemis board sent back to the computer a string. The string was then printed out in the Python terminal 
                            after receiving the string.

                            In task 2, I had to program the SEND_THREE_FLOATS command to send three floats from the computer to the artemis board. 
                            I followed the format of that of SEND_TWO_INTS which allowed me to send three floats to the Artemis board to then be printed 
                            in the serial monitor.

                            Before I can begin task 3, I had to declare the command in the command types and in ble.arduino.ino. Once I had that setup in the Arduino side, I did a string that would have "T:", representing time, and then the time in milliseconds (used the built in function). 
                            I realize now that I should have added the units of time. Even so, in the Python side, I was able to print out string that was sent from the Artemis board.

                            As shown below:

                            In task 5, I created a new command called TIME_LOOP. This command essentially had a start time which would be stored.
                            In the while loop, it would send a string to the computer of the number of counts and the time in milliseconds for 5 secs. 
                            Once we had the recieved the string, we can then calculate the effective data transfer rate.
                            
                            My math: 
                            Each timestep is a int and therefore each is 2 bytes. 
                            since there are 128 data points => 128*2 = 256 bytes
                            number of seconds elapsed is 5 secs
                            => that 256 bytes/5 secs = 51.2 bytes/sec

                            time would be stored in the time_array. The time_array would then be sent to the computer through a for loop which

                            I implemented the same logic as in task 6, but instead of just storing time, I also stored the temperature readings. 
                            I created a temp array that is the same size as time_array. I would then string the time and the temperature to be sent 
                            to the computer.

                        In the frist method, the disadvange was that it only sent one message to the computer, 
                        and it was very quick to send the message to the computer (did it in less than a second).
                        In the second method, the advantage was that you were able to into two arrays and then send the 
                        values of the arrays to the computer. The disadvange was that it was not as quick as the frist method, 
                        the time elasdped was 9secs. Please keep in mind in both methods, the arrays were of the same size.
                        Another advantage is that since it is slower, it may be able to get accurate data, but you will not be able to 
                        anaylze the data in real-time. The second method has a data transfer rate of ...

                        Each timestep is a float and therefore each is 4 bytes. 
                        since there are 128 data points => 20*4 = 80 bytes
                        number of seconds elapsed is 9 secs
                        => that 80 bytes/9 secs = 8.9  bytes/sec

                        Considering that the Artemis board has 384kB of RAM and a float is 4 bytes, the maximum number of floats that can be stored is 96,000. 
                        If we consdier the second method, the time_array and temp_array,each 4 bytes, the maximum number of floats that can be stored is 48,000.

                            In task 5, I created a new command called TIME_LOOP. This command essentially had a start time which would be stored.
                            In the while loop, it would send a string to the computer of the number of counts and the time in milliseconds for 5 secs. 
                            Once we had the recieved the string, we can then calculate the effective data transfer rate.
                            
                            My math: 
                            Each timestep is a int and therefore each is 2 bytes. 
                            since there are 128 data points => 128*2 = 256 bytes
                            number of seconds elapsed is 5 secs
                            => that 256 bytes/5 secs = 51.2 bytes/sec
