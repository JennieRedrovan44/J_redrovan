                        <p>
                        Before going into the lab, I planned out how to connect the ToF sensor to the Artemis board. I used the following connections: <br><br>
                        add image of setup 
                        <img src="assets/img_lab2/set_up_connection.png" alt = "set_up_connection" width=90% /><br><br>
                        Since we have two ToF sensors, both will have the same I2C address by default. Since we cannot have two 
                        devices with the same address on the same bus, we need to change the address of one of the sensors. <br><br>
                        The I2C bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a form of communication between multiple devices by using serial (bit by bit)
                        communication. Essentially, the master device is the Arthemis board and it sends a message, and the slave devices, like the ToF, has a address to which it 
                        recognizes adn then it responds back. In simplier terms, the master device asks the slave device for data, the slave device sends the data back to the master device. <br><br>
                        However, each slave device, the two ToFs, must have a unique address. How I will ensure that both ToF have different address is I will wire a the XSHUT pin to one of the Arthemis GPIO pin. 
                        Then, I will distable on of the ToF by setting the GPIO pin to low (0), and then I will change it's address and then turn it back on. By doing this 
                        the ToF that is disabled will have a different address than the ToF that is enabled. <br><br>
                        What I am currently planning to place the ToF in front and the back of the car. The reason why I think this would 
                        a better choice because this allows the car to detect objects in front of it and behind it. This is important because 
                        if the car is going forward and it detects an object in front of it, it can stop. If the car is going backwards and it detects an object behind it. 
                        A concern that I do have is it may not be able to detect its blind side or obstacles. However, I think this is a good start to 
                        where the ToF can potentally go. Another position would be side and front, but it won't be to detect the back. I will have to think about this 
                        more as I go through the lab. <br><br>

                            I soldered the JST connector to the 650mAh batteries to which I then used to 
                            power the Artemis. I then tested commands from lab 1 to check the BLE connection
                            by powering the Artemis with the just the battery, as shown above!
