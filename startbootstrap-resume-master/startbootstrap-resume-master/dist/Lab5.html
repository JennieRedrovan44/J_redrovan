                        <h3 class="mb-0">Before the Prelab:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Before starting the prelab, I had to separate my code into different C++ header files. Like Stephan, I was getting tired of constantly 
                            scrolling and keeping track of all my initializations at the beginning of my code. 
                            Managing everything in one place was becoming overwhelming. So, I decided to separate my code into different files to keep everything organized. 
                            This allowed me to keep everything structured and made it easier for me to navigate.<br><br>
                            I created header files for ble.hpp, imu.hpp, tof.hpp, motors.hpp, cmd_types.h. For this lab, I created another header called PID.hpp. <br><br>
                            Finally, I modified ble.arduino.ino to move the initializations of BLE and TOF into the setup function for better organization. <br><br>
                            
                            <h4>Prelab</h4>
                            Now that I had a better structure of my code, I was ready to start the prelab. <br><br>
                            Firstly, I created new commands specifically, I created start_PID, stop_PID, SEND_PID_DATA. <br><br>
                            <strong>For start_PID:</strong> <br><br>
                            I created a new command called start_PID which is used to start the PID controller. <br><br>
                            In this command, I set the run_PID_CASE to 1 which is used to start the PID controller. <br><br>
                            I also would set the desired speed, desired distance, kp, ki, kd to the values that I want to use for the PID controller. <br><br>
                            Sending the command from Jupyter notebook:<br><br>
                            <img src="assets/img_lab5/IMG_command_start_PID.png" alt="scanning" width="90%" /><br><br>
                            The case corresponding to the command: <br><br>
                            <img src="assets/img_lab5/IMG_command_start_PID_case.png" alt="scanning" width="90%" /><br><br>
                            <strong>For stop_PID:</strong> <br><br>
                            Sending the command from Jupyter notebook:<br><br>
                            <img src="assets/img_lab5/IMG_command_stop_PID.png" alt="scanning" width="50%" /><br><br>
                            The case corresponding to the command: <br><br>
                            <img src="assets/img_lab5/IMG_command_stop_PID_case.png" alt="scanning" width="50%" /><br><br>
                            When the command from Jupyter is sent to the robot, the robot will stop the PID controller given that run_PID_CASE will now be 0 (no longer true so loop will not run).<br><br>
                            <strong>For SEND_PID_DATA:</strong> <br><br>
                            Sending the command from Jupyter notebook:<br><br>
                            <img src="assets/img_lab5/IMG_command_send_PID.png" alt="scanning" width="90%" /><br><br>
                            The case corresponding to the command: <br><br>
                            <img src="assets/img_lab5/IMG_SEND_PID_DATA_PRELAB.png" alt="scanning" width="90%" /><br><br>
                            When the command from Jupyter is sent to the robot, the robot will send the PID data back to Jupyter notebook. I included the snippet on how the data is being processed as shown above.<br><br>

                        <p>
                            Since I am a level 5000 student, I could choose between PI or PID. I choose to go with PID as I wanted to be able to control the car more accurately. <br><br>
                            The PID equation is shown below:<br><br>

                            The final code that I used throughout the lab is shown below:<br><br>
                            When the command from Jupyter is sent to the robot, the robot will start the PID controller given that run_PID_CASE will now be 1 <br><br>
                            When run_PID_CASE is 1 it will start the PID which is called in the void loop. Code snippet below:<br><br>

                            The forward and backward functions are called in the PID_start function, the corresponding code snippet is shown below:<br><br>

                            The proportional gain (Kp) is the difference between the setpoint and the TOF reading.The setpoint that was used was 304mm (which is about 1ft away from the wall). <br><br>
                            I set the ki and kd to 0 in the start_PID command for now as I wanted to see how the robot would behave with just the proportional gain. <br><br>
                            I tested kp at kp = .03, .04, and .05 <br><br>
                            I have included the plots and videos for each of the kp values below. <br><br>

                            For the plots and videos above, I calibrated wheels in order for the robot to move straight. <br><br>
                            I included a video of the robot with PID linear control with just the proportional gain without any calibration as shown below: <br><br>

                            width="560"

                            </iframe><br><br>
                            As you can see, the robot is not able to move straight. This is because the wheels are not calibrated. <br><br>
                            Also, I tried implementing a higher value for kp = .06 but the robot would hit the wall and flip over.<br><br>
                            
                            After analyzing the plots and videos, I decided to go with kp = .05 as it was the most stable and there was much less oscillations and was faster compared to kp=.03 and .03<br><br> 
                            <h2>Implementing Ki</h2> <br><br>
                            The integral gain (Ki) is the sum of the error over time. This is used to eliminate the steady-state error. <br><br>
