                        <p>
                        For this lab, I used PID orientation control to scan and map out a space. I placed my robot in different spots and had it slowly spin in place while taking distance readings using the ToF sensor. Since I couldn’t use the lab room, I used a hallway instead. <br><br>
                        </p>   
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <h3 class="mb-0">Orientation Control</h3>
                        <p>
                            For mapping, I went with orientation control. Initially, my robot wasn’t performing well at angles other than zero. After talking to Aidan Derocher, he pointed out that my Kp was too high, which was causing the system to overshoot. I lowered Kp to 0.9 and added a Ki value of 0.01. That made the robot way more stable and able to hold its position at different angles. Once it was tuned, I was able to get 24-degree increments and take 3 readings per spot. To run the mapping routine, I added a BLE command to the Artemis that would start the process.<br><br>
                            code snippet:<br><br>

                            <img src="assets/img_lab9/mapit3_ble.png" alt="Flip Code Snippet" width="90%" /><br><br>

                            This command makes the car turn to each angle using the PID controller until it’s close enough—within 4 degrees. Once it gets there, it takes 3 TOF readings while staying still. In Python, I set the step size to 24 degrees, which gave me 45 data points per spot.

                            While testing, I tuned the PID values to make the turns smoother and more consistent (Kp = 1.0 , Ki = 0.01, Kd = 0). You can see how it moves in the video below.

                            While I do see that my robot does go a little slower than it should be when rotating, but I found that keeping at this kp and ki kept the car from going unstable. I would like to tune it a little more, but I did not have much time as I would hope. <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Since I got mapping to work after office hours, I could not use the four desinated locations in the arena setup in the lab. Instead, I used the hallway and placed my robot in four distinct locations. 
                            After taking the measurement from each location, I sent the data over to python which I would later be able to plot. <br><br>
                            I was able to get a good amount of data from each location. I was able to get 3 readings per angle, and I took 15 angles per location. I then averaged the data and plotted it in polar coordinates. <br><br>
                            Location where I took the measurements:<br><br>

                            I marked approximately where I took the measurements in the image above. <br><br>
                            I then plotted in the polar coordinate plot. <br><br>

                        <p>
                            Next, I converted the distance readings (which were taken relative to the robot) into global coordinates for the hallway map. I used a 3x3 transformation matrix <code>T</code> that rotates and shifts each point based on the robot’s orientation and position:<br><br>
                        
                            <code>
                                T = [R | d] = 
                                [
                                cos(θ)  -sin(θ)  x <br>
                                sin(θ)   cos(θ)  y <br>
                                0           0           1
                                ]
                            </code><br><br>
                        
                            I also used two position vectors <code>P₁</code> and <code>P₂</code> to represent where the front and rear TOF sensors are on the robot:<br><br>
                        
                            <code>
                                P₁ = [
                                TOF₁ <br>
                                0 <br>
                                1
                                ] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                P₂ = [
                                -TOF₂ <br>
                                0 <br>
                                1
                                ]
                            </code><br><br>
                        
                            In my case, the front sensor <code>TOF₁</code> is about 2.5 inches in front of center, and the rear sensor <code>TOF₂</code> is about 3 inches behind center. I applied these offsets to the readings from each sensor, then used the transformation matrix to convert everything into global hallway coordinates.<br><br>
                        
                            After plotting all the data together, I got a rough map of the hallway based on both sensors from four different positions. Each spot had its own little quirks, but overall it gave me a decent idea of the space.
